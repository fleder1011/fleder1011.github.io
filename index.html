                    Hallo. We are looking for highly intelligent friends. To find them, we have devised a test.
                    <br><br>
                    There is a chain of 5 puzzles,
                    <br>
                    Solve them, and it will lead you on the road to finding us.
                    <br><br>
                    LEVEL 1 below refers to a specific location in the University.
                    <br>
                    When you find it, take a picture of that place and send it to this Discord account <span class="accountName">fleder.1011</span> to get the next puzzle.
                    <br><br>

                    <br><br>
